# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various attributes such as `Brand`, `Model`, `Fuel_Type`, and `Transmission`. It demonstrates data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and regression modeling in Python.

## Dataset & Preprocessing
- The dataset contains categorical and numerical features of cars.  
- Categorical columns (`Brand`, `Model`, `Fuel_Type`, `Transmission`) were encoded into numeric values for model compatibility.  
- The target variable is `Price`. The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Modeling
- A **Linear Regression** algorithm was used to predict car prices based on the features.  
- The project highlights basic regression workflow including data preparation, training, and prediction.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
